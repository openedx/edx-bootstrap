=============
edX Bootstrap
=============

This library is an extension of `Bootstrap 4 <http://getbootstrap.com>`_
for use with edX and openEdX.

Installation
------------

Using npm::

    npm install --save @edx/edx-bootstrap

Usage
-----

Add the following import in your project's base scss file::

    @import "~@edx/edx-bootstrap/scss/edx/theme.scss";

Or for Open edX users::

    @import "~@edx/edx-bootstrap/scss/open-edx/theme.scss";

This includes everything you need. Bootstrap is included so you don't 
need to add it in your project. If you need more control, see the 
theming section.

Alternatively, you can download this repo and use one of the compiled outputs:

- ``dist/open-edx/theme.css`` (Open edX bootstrap, extensions, & theme)
- ``dist/edx/theme.css`` (edX bootstrap, extensions, & theme)
- ``dist/core/core.css`` (edX bootstrap & extensions only)

Theming
-------

The content of a `theme.scss` file::
    
    // Optional
    @import "my-fonts";
    @import "my-variables";

    // Required core (includes bootstrap and extensions)
    @import "@edx/edx-boostrap/scss/core/core.scss";

    // The rest of your scss
    // ...

To create a theme, make a copy of the ``scss/open-edx`` folder in your own project
and make changes. Then include it before you include edx-bootstrap::

    @import "fonts";
    @import "variables";

    // If you are creating your own theme remove
    // the "../core/core" import with the line below.
    @import "../core/core";
    // @import "@edx/edx-boostrap/scss/core/core.scss";

    @import "overrides";
